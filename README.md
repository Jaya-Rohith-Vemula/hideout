# 🕵️‍♂️ Hideout  
**Secret chats. No names. No traces.**  

Hideout is a minimal and privacy-focused chat application built with **WebSockets**.  
You can create secret chat rooms with **short IDs** or **custom room names**, share them with friends, and chat securely without leaving any identity behind.  

✨ If someone asks — *“Was that you?”* — you can always say *“No, it wasn’t me.”* 😉
